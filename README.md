Python SDN Controller

A Python-based Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller using Ryu and OpenFlow, designed for network automation, simulation, and learning. This project demonstrates how to programmatically control network traffic and simulate networks using Mininet, with potential for multicloud experimentation.

⸻

Overview

This project was built to explore SDN concepts in a practical, hands-on way. It allows you to:
	•	Forward and manage traffic dynamically
	•	Simulate networks locally using Mininet
	•	Experiment with flow rules, routing, and traffic policies
	•	Lay the groundwork for multicloud network automation

⸻

Features
	•	Python-based controller with Ryu
	•	OpenFlow-compatible
	•	Local network simulation with Mininet
	•	Extensible for custom rules, monitoring, or multicloud integration

⸻

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-sdn-controller.git
cd python-sdn-controller

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install mininet

3. Run Mininet
Simulate a simple network:
sudo mn --topo single,3 --controller remote

This creates:
	•	1 virtual switch
	•	3 virtual hosts

4. Start the SDN Controller
ryu-manager controllers/simple_controller.py

How It Works

The controller listens for switch events and installs flow rules dynamically. In this version, it acts as a basic learning switch:
	•	Forwards traffic to the correct host
	•	Can be extended to block or prioritize traffic
	•	Can monitor traffic flows in real time

⸻

Next Steps / Ideas
	•	Dynamic routing between different network segments
	•	Traffic prioritization and Quality of Service (QoS)
	•	Integrate with cloud VPCs for multicloud SDN experiments
	•	Add security rules and automated network policies

⸻

Requirements
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Ryu SDN framework
	•	Mininet for network simulation
	•	Optional: Linux environment or WSL for Windows
